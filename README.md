<h1>Flying Digital Editions</h1>
<h2> A tool for enhancing digital text exploration through Wikidata</h2>

<p>
  This project represents the result of my DHDK thesis which aim is to provide both expert and non-expert users with a tool that can create a manage a lightweight digital edition, by leveraging existing technologies and aumotating processes where possible.
  The process begins with a simple text, which will be analysed through a text annotation process. The infromation about the retrieved entities (provided by Wikidata), will be then visualized through a summarising panel.
